👋 Hi! I'm Emre, a Full Stack Developer student currently focusing on Front-end technologies.

👨‍💻 I'm learning to build modern web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while exploring React and other popular libraries to improve user experience.

💡 In addition to Front-end development, I'm also in the process of learning the necessary programming languages and technologies for Full Stack development, gaining experience step by step.

🌍 I aim to contribute to open-source projects, continuously expand my skills, and grow as a developer.

🚀 Here, I'll be sharing my projects and progress. 🚀
